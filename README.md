fontawesom-icon-list
====================

HTML code for font awesome icons 4.1

<b>How to use:</b>
1. Open index.html, copy all the code and paste it wherever you want to use it! Simple as that!

I simply wanted a dropdown list of all the available fonts for a project I am working on. I wrote a tiny script to scrape 
all the fontawesome classes from fontawesome's website. And thats it!
